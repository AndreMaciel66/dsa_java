Data Structure Algorithms using JAVA.

This repo is a learning notes, codes, and all the good stuff you can also learn in the following course link:

[data structures and algorithms java](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-java)


BIG O, is a way to compare code 1 with code 2, and see what code is more efficient.

## Time complexity

> the code is measured not about how much time it takes to run, but in how many operations it takes to execute 
> something.

## Space complexity

> how much memory it takes to execute, considering time complexity per space complexity.

In this course we'll be focusing on Time complexity.
